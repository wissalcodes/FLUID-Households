#FLUID Households is a flutter based water level monitoring app. 
It uses a webserver to store the water level collected by the ultrasonic sensor, displayed to the user in the form of a chart containing both the water volume left inside the tank and the percentage. 
It also enables the user to update the information relative to their tank, including tank shape, dimensions, and ID.
